## Code Style

- **Python 3.10+** - use modern syntax (`|` unions, `match` statements)
- **Ruff** for linting and formatting (config in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Type hints** everywhere - use `ty` for type checking
- **Frozen dataclasses** for configs (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`)
- **Line length**: 120 characters

## Python Patterns

Follow these patterns when extending the codebase:

- **Frozen dataclasses for config** - Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for all configuration objects. Immutability prevents accidental mutation and makes code easier to reason about.
- **Protocol over ABC** - Prefer `typing.Protocol` for interface definitions (see `BackendProtocol`). Enables duck typing without inheritance coupling.
- **marshmallow_dataclass for validation** - Combine dataclasses with marshmallow schemas for type-safe config loading with validation. Custom fields (e.g., `BackendConfigField`) handle polymorphic deserialization.
- **Factory classmethods** - Use `@classmethod` named `from_*` for construction (e.g., `RuntimeContext.from_config()`, `RunMetadata.from_json()`). Keep `__init__` simple.
- **TYPE_CHECKING guard** - Import type-only dependencies under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` to avoid circular imports. Use string annotations for forward refs.
- **Computed properties** - Use `@property` for derived values instead of storing computed state. See `ResourceConfig.gpus_per_prefill`, `RunMetadata.topology_label`.
- **Registry pattern** - Use decorators for extensible registration (`@register_benchmark("sa-bench")`). New implementations just decorate and import.
- **TypedDict for external data** - Use `TypedDict` for typing dicts from JSON/external sources where you can't control the structure.
- **Single source of truth** - Create context objects (like `RuntimeContext`) that compute all derived paths/values once at startup rather than recomputing.
- **testing** - when we make a new significant feature change, we should always add a new test
- **Unused parameters stay untouched** - A hook that ignores an argument just ignores it. Ruff's unused-argument rules are off, so `del name` lines add nothing but noise.

## Design Rules

Read these before adding a feature. Each rule names the existing pattern to reuse. The most common review finding in this repo is a new mechanism where one already exists.

- **Names go in tables, never in branches.** A connector, vendor, router, exporter, or engine name is compared as a string in exactly one place: the table or registry that owns it (`_CONNECTOR_MAP` in `backends/vllm.py`, `@register_service`, `@register_benchmark`, `get_frontend`). Consumers read attributes of the row, not the name. If a change adds `if x == "<name>"` in two files, or repeats a `Literal["a", "b"]` across modules, it is a missing table row or a missing config field.
- **Cluster differences live in `srtslurm.yaml`.** Anything that varies by cluster or hardware (NIC, visible-devices env var, default GPU exporter, sbatch directives, mounts, host setup) is a `ClusterConfig` field in `core/schema.py` following `network_interface` and the `default_*` blocks, read once into `RuntimeContext`. A vendor enum in Python is the wrong tool for this. Never call `load_cluster_config()` from a schema property or a stage: it is uncached and creates a second source of truth.
- **One resolver per overridable setting.** A setting the recipe can set at engine level and override per role (`roles.<role>.args.connector`, DP size) has one accessor on the backend in the `get_config_for_mode` style (`VLLMProtocol.connector_for_mode`, with `kv_connector_for_mode` for the table row and `kv_transfer_config(mode)` for the flag), and every consumer uses it: command builder, process env, frontend, and schema validator. Two readers of the raw fields disagree the moment a role override appears.
- **Frontends own readiness; backends own worker commands and ports.** `core/health.py` and the stage mixins contain no `frontend_type == "..."` checks and no `getattr(frontend, "hook", fallback)` probing. The frontend implements the protocol hook; if a hook is missing, add it to `FrontendProtocol`. A frontend asks a backend a question through a method (`backend.is_grpc_mode(mode)`), never by reading its fields by name.
- **Backends answer through `BackendProtocol`, never through `getattr`.** The stage mixins, schema validators, services, and dry-run ask `backend.mooncake_kv_store`, `backend.failover`, `backend.get_environment_for_mode(mode)`, `backend.get_srun_config().sequential_node_start`; a backend without the feature returns `None` or `{}`. `getattr(backend, "x", default)` and `hasattr(backend, "f")` do not appear in `src/`: they pass on every backend, so a typo or a rename fails silently at runtime. Logic that is genuinely one engine's narrows with `isinstance(backend, VLLMProtocol)` and reads typed fields. When a consumer needs a new answer, add the member to `BackendProtocol` and implement it on every backend, including the neutral default.
- **Every listener a process opens comes from the allocator.** Two processes can share a node in this repo (`nodes: colocate`, DP endpoints), so any port a worker binds (HTTP, bootstrap, side channel, handshake, notify, metrics) is allocated by `NodePortAllocator` and carried on `Process`. An upstream default port left in a generated config is a collision on the first colocated recipe. See Ports below.
- **Modes are not types.** A new `frontend.type`, `services[].type`, or `engine.type` is for a different process with its own launch, health API, and registration model. A different CLI shape, transport, or discovery mode of the same binary is an override inside the existing class: `trtllm_serve` handles aggregate and disaggregated in one type, `sglang-router` picks http or grpc per mode. A new frontend type is one registered module; the only remaining name checks are for Dynamo- and sglang-router-specific features (request tracing, the gateway's own metrics listener, `slow_down`).
- **Check upstream before working around it.** When a change encodes an upstream behavior (what a health endpoint returns, which keys a connector reads, what a flag does), read the upstream source at the version the container ships and cite the commit in the PR. Do not add a probe, shim, or port-scan workaround for something upstream already handles.
- **Reuse the machinery before adding a mechanism.** Services plus `placement` before a bespoke launcher, `roles.<role>.restart` before a wrapper loop, `host_setup` before a setup script that needs the host. The smallest diff that rides existing machinery beats a self-contained new module.
- **A user-visible feature ships complete.** A `tests/` case (dry-run for visible config, mock orchestrator for behavior), a `docs/` page or section, an example recipe under `examples/`, and regenerated `docs/schema-reference.md`. In a stacked PR, a test lives in the layer that introduces the behavior it asserts.

## Key Concepts

### RuntimeContext

Single source of truth for computed paths. Created once at job start:

```python
runtime = RuntimeContext.from_config(config, job_id)
runtime.log_dir          # /path/to/logs/12345_1P_4D_...
runtime.head_node_ip     # 10.0.0.1
runtime.container_mounts # List of mount strings
```

### Endpoint Allocation

Maps logical workers to physical nodes/GPUs:

```python
endpoints = allocate_endpoints(
    num_prefill=2, num_decode=4, num_agg=0,
    gpus_per_prefill=8, gpus_per_decode=4, gpus_per_agg=0,
    gpus_per_node=8,
    available_nodes=("node0", "node1", "node2"),
)
# Returns List[Endpoint] with node assignments and GPU indices
```

### Health Checks

Readiness is the frontend's: `probe_ready(host, port, expected_prefill, expected_decode, config)` performs one check against the public endpoint and returns a `WorkerHealthResult`, raising `requests.RequestException` while the endpoint is down; `config` is the recipe, for a frontend whose readiness contract depends on it (the vLLM Router probes a different endpoint when its workers register through a discovery connector). `wait_for_model` in `core/health.py` owns only timing, abort, and progress logging. The three probe shapes live in `core/health.py`:

```python
probe_json_health(host, port, "/workers", parse, n_prefill, n_decode)  # a JSON worker count through parse (Dynamo /health, router /workers)
probe_http_ok(host, port, "/health", "ready message")                   # a bare 200 (trtllm-serve)
probe_direct_server(host, port)                                          # /health, then /v1/models must list a model (direct vllm, sglang)
```

Expected counts come from the frontend too: `health_expectations(config, processes)` returns `(prefill, decode, description)` in the units its endpoint reports. Aggregate workers count as decode; Dynamo counts vLLM DP registrations, vLLM Router counts the ranks it expands each URL into, everything else counts logical workers.

### Frontends

The frontend is the process that owns the public OpenAI port (`FRONTEND_PUBLIC_PORT`) and decides when the job is ready. Implementations live under `src/srtctl/frontends/`, register with `@register_frontend("<type>")`, and are imported from the package `__init__`; `frontend.type` resolves through that registry (`get_frontend`, `list_frontend_types`) and nowhere else. Registered today: `dynamo` (etcd/NATS discovery), `sglang-router` and `vllm-router` (static URL routers, both built on `StaticRouterFrontend`), `trtllm_serve` (direct aggregate or the disaggregated orchestrator), `sglang` and `vllm` (one direct worker owns the port); `none` is the services-only job with no implementation and no gate.

`FrontendProtocol` hooks: `required_backend` and `validate(config)` (recipe rules, run by `SrtConfig._validate_frontend` at load so dry-run catches them; raise `ValueError` with the user-facing message), `health_endpoint` and `parse_health` (readiness), `get_backend_health_urls` (second gate: every advertised worker URL must answer 200 before traffic), `start_frontends` (launch on `topology.frontend_nodes`, one `ManagedProcess` per node with a `step_name`), `get_frontend_args_list` (`frontend.args` to CLI). The schema knows no individual frontend: pairing and per-type rules come from these two members.

Two base classes cover the two ways a frontend learns about its workers. `DynamicFrontend` (`frontends/dynamic_frontend.py`) is for frontends whose workers register themselves over a discovery plane: it fronts any engine, needs no per-worker URL gate, and no worker is the public endpoint; Dynamo is its only implementation. A router binary that can also take static URLs (vLLM Router's ZMQ discovery mode) is a mode of a static router, not a dynamic frontend. `StaticRouterFrontend` (`frontends/static_router.py`) is the base for routers that take worker URLs on the command line. Subclasses set `executable`, `pd_flag`, `process_name` and override only what differs: `worker_scheme` (http or grpc per mode), `worker_bootstrap_port` (the P/D port advertised next to a prefill URL), `resolve_worker_host`, `get_managed_frontend_args` (arguments derived from the allocated topology; a conflicting user value raises instead of being overwritten), `build_bash_preamble`, `build_router_command`, `start_process` (test seam). `collect_workers` treats a positive `Process.http_port` as the definition of a routable worker.

Readiness runs in `BenchmarkStageMixin._wait_for_service_ready`: `wait_for_model` owns timing, abort, and progress logging, and calls the frontend's `probe_ready(host, port, n_prefill, n_decode, config)` once per poll with counts from the frontend's `health_expectations(config, processes)`; then `get_backend_health_urls` are polled with `wait_for_http_endpoints`. A probe raises `requests.RequestException` while the endpoint is down and otherwise returns a `WorkerHealthResult`. `core/health.py` has the three probe shapes to build on: `probe_json_health` (a JSON worker count through `parse_health`), `probe_http_ok` (a bare 200), `probe_direct_server` (`/health` then `/v1/models`). No frontend name appears in `wait_for_model` or `_get_health_expectations`.

The frontend also owns the worker shape, and backends read it instead of comparing names: `worker_launch` (`dynamo` workers register with the Dynamo runtime, `direct` workers are the engine's own server), `worker_api_port(mode)` (`public` when the worker is itself the endpoint and binds `runtime.frontend_port`, `allocated` when a router fronts it on `Process.http_port`), and `expands_node_local_dp` (vLLM Router expands per-node hybrid-LB pools, so the vLLM backend launches one API per node and refuses `per_gpu`). `build_worker_command` still takes `frontend_type` and resolves it through `get_frontend`; a new router mode is therefore one frontend override plus, at most, a new attribute on the protocol.

Which rank serves what is the frontend's call too, one method per consumer: `worker_metrics_port(process, runtime)` and `metrics_path` feed the tachometer scrape targets and the AIPerf metrics URLs (Dynamo: every rank on its system port; native servers: the leader or each routable pool on its HTTP port), `worker_endpoint_port(process, config, runtime)` feeds the `PREFILL_IPS`-style benchmark env (one per logical worker), `profiling_control_port` and `profiling_control_is_leader_only` feed iteration-triggered nsys control, `direct_endpoint_nodes(processes)` names the nodes whose worker is itself the public endpoint, and `worker_ready_port(process)` is what sequential endpoint start polls. `core/telemetry.py` and the benchmark stage contain no frontend-name checks; `BenchmarkStageMixin.frontend` is `None` for a services-only job.

### Ports

Fixed ports are constants in `src/srtctl/ports.py`. Every port a worker process binds is a `PortKind` in the same module (`name`, `base`, `stride`, `per_node`) and is handed out by `NodePortAllocator.next(kind, node, size)` in `src/srtctl/core/topology.py`: per-node counters for listeners only bound on that node (`HTTP_PORTS`, `BOOTSTRAP_PORTS`, `DP_RPC_PORTS`, `DIST_INIT_PORTS`) and global counters for side channels peers address (`SYS_PORTS`, `KV_EVENTS_PORTS`, `NIXL_PORTS`, `KVBM_ZMQ_PORTS`, `NCCL_PORTS`, `VLLM_SCAN_PORTS`, `MORIIO_HANDSHAKE_PORTS`, `MORIIO_NOTIFY_PORTS`, `TRTLLM_DIST_INIT_PORTS`, `SIDECAR_GRPC_PORTS`). `size > 1` reserves a block when the engine adds a rank offset to the port it is given (MoRI-IO adds the local DP and TP rank to its notify base). `endpoints_to_processes` allocates the generic kinds and stores them on `Process`; a backend adds its engine-specific kinds with `dataclasses.replace` on the way out (SGLang `nccl_port` and `dist_init_port`, vLLM `vllm_scan_port` or, for a discovery connector, `moriio_handshake_port` and `moriio_notify_port`, TRT-LLM `trtllm_dist_init_port`). `do_sweep` builds the one allocator per job, seeding the sidecar gRPC base from `dynamo.sidecar_port`.

Rules that follow: a new listener is a new `PortKind` plus a `Process` field, allocated in the topology builder, never `some_base + (sys_port - DYN_SYSTEM_PORT_BASE)` or any other arithmetic on another port at command-build time. Consumers read the field; a `None` means the topology was built without that kind, and a consumer that needs it raises rather than guessing. A worker's own address is `get_hostname_ip(node, runtime.network_interface)`, not upstream's interface guess. Fixed scan bases such as `VLLM_PORT` exist only to keep co-located `get_open_port()` scans apart; if a connector allocates inside forked children, leave the base unset so the kernel assigns ports. Frontends bind `FRONTEND_PUBLIC_PORT` (8000), or `FRONTEND_INTERNAL_PORT` (8180) behind nginx when `enable_multiple_frontends` is set. Service ports are `ServiceKind` defaults overridden by `options`. `tests/test_port_allocator.py` asserts over every example recipe that no two processes on a node share a port and global kinds never repeat.

### Status Reporting

Optional fire-and-forget HTTP status reporting to one or more collectors. Configure in `srtslurm.yaml`:

```yaml
# Cluster-level config (srtslurm.yaml)
cluster: "bruh"  # Cluster name for dashboard display
reporting:
  status:
    endpoint: "http://login-node:8080"
```

**srtctl status-server** is the in-repo collector for that endpoint (`src/srtctl/status_server/`: `store.py` is the SQLite side, `server.py` the stdlib HTTP side validating with `srtctl.contract`, `ui/index.html` the dependency-free single-page UI served at `/`, which fetches the same `/api` routes with the read token from `localStorage`). It appends an event whenever `(status, stage, message)` changes, creates a placeholder row for a PUT whose POST never arrived, and serves cursor-based feeds at `/api/events` and `/api/jobs/{id}/events`. `make_server(store, port=0)` gives tests a real server on an ephemeral port (`tests/test_status_server.py` drives it with the real `StatusReporter`). The wire contract is `docs/status-api-spec.md`; a payload field changes in `srtctl.contract`, the server, and the spec together.

**StatusReporter** - Used in `do_sweep.py` to report job lifecycle:

```python
from srtctl.core.status import StatusReporter, JobStatus, JobStage

reporter = StatusReporter.from_config(config.reporting, job_id)
reporter.report_started(config, runtime)  # Job started, with model/resources/head_node/log_dir metadata
reporter.report(JobStatus.WORKERS, JobStage.WORKERS, "Starting workers")
reporter.report_completed(exit_code, logs_url=s3_url)  # Final status
```

**Status lifecycle** (status is the stage being entered, not readiness):
```
submitted → starting → workers → frontend → benchmark → completed | failed
stages: starting, head_infrastructure, preflight, workers, frontend, benchmark, cleanup
```

**create_job_record()** - Standalone function for job submission:

```python
from srtctl.core.status import create_job_record

# Called in submit.py after sbatch succeeds
create_job_record(
    reporting=config.reporting,
    job_id=job_id,
    job_name=config.name,
    cluster=get_srtslurm_setting("cluster"),
    recipe=str(config_path),
    metadata=metadata,  # Tags go in metadata["tags"]
)
```

**Key behaviors:**
- All HTTP requests have 5-second timeout
- Failures are logged at DEBUG and silently ignored
- Job execution is never blocked by status reporting
- Tags are passed via `metadata["tags"]` (not a separate field)
- `metadata["log_dir"]` (from `report_started`) is the run's log directory on the cluster filesystem; `logs_url` is only set when `reporting.s3` uploads it
- `report_started` also repeats `job_name` and `cluster` in `metadata`: the submit-time POST is one attempt (now two) from the login node, and when it is lost the collector's placeholder row (`job-<id>`) takes its identity from the started report; a late POST fills whatever is still null, only ever moves `submitted_at` earlier, and never rewinds status; every reporter request gets two attempts
- `reporting.s3` uploads follow a policy (`DEFAULT_S3_EXCLUDE` / `DEFAULT_S3_ARCHIVE` in `core/schema.py`): aiperf's per-interval metrics scrapes, `perf_dashboard_bundle/` and `perf_dashboard.json` are skipped (tachometer parquet holds the same series; a 2 GB run becomes about 60 MB), aiperf's per-request `profile_export.jsonl` is packed into `bundle.tar.zst` by the inline `ARCHIVE_SCRIPT` in `postprocess_stage.py`, which runs in the plain `python:3.11` upload container (stdlib + optional `zstandard`, xz fallback). Change the policy in the schema constants and `docs/config-reference.md` together
- Auth is a bearer token read from `$SRTCTL_STATUS_TOKEN` on both sides (`reporting.status.token_env` renames the variable). Never add a literal token field: `SrtConfig.Schema().dump` lands in the lockfile and resolved configs are copied into `logs/` and synced to S3. The reporter never follows redirects and warns on 3xx/401/403; the server refuses to listen beyond loopback without a token unless `--allow-unauthenticated`

### Services (etcd, NATS, Mooncake master, exporters)

Everything that is not a worker or the frontend is a service (`src/srtctl/services/`, launched by `ServiceStageMixin`). The Dynamo frontend implies `etcd` and `nats`, `backend.mooncake_kv_store` implies `mooncake-master`, tachometer implies `dcgm-exporter` and `node-exporter` on every worker node (`services/implicit.py`). A recipe declares one by name only to change it:

```yaml
services:
  - name: etcd
    type: etcd
    placement:
      node: dedicated    # reserve a node for the discovery plane (v1: infra.etcd_nats_dedicated_node)
  - name: nats
    type: nats
    placement:
      node: dedicated
    options:
      max_payload_mb: 24 # v1: infra.nats_max_payload_mb
```

`services/normalize.py` maps declared etcd/nats/mooncake-master entries back onto `infra` and `backend.mooncake_kv_store` before schema load, so the runtime reads one set of fields. Adding a kind: subclass `ServiceKind` in `services/`, `@register_service("<type>")`, import it from `services/__init__.py`; if the rest of the recipe should imply it, add it to `implied_services`. See `docs/services.md`.

### Mooncake KV Store

When `mooncake_kv_store` is set under an SGLang or vLLM backend, srtslurm:
1. Launches `mooncake_master` on the infra node (same node as etcd/nats)
2. Injects `MOONCAKE_MASTER=<infra_ip>:8700` on all workers automatically
3. Passes through any env vars in `mooncake_kv_store.env` to all workers
4. For vLLM, also renders `mooncake_kv_store.store_config` into the JSON file
   pointed to by `MOONCAKE_CONFIG_PATH` (vLLM's `MooncakeStoreConnector` reads
   its config from JSON, not env vars). See `docs/mooncake-kv-store.md`.

```yaml
backend:
  type: sglang
  mooncake_kv_store:
    container: nvcr.io/nvidia/mooncake:latest  # optional, defaults to job container
    env:                                        # direct MOONCAKE_* / SGLANG_* env vars
      MOONCAKE_PROTOCOL: rdma
      MOONCAKE_GLOBAL_SEGMENT_SIZE: "4gb"
      MOONCAKE_DEVICE: mlx5_0
  sglang_config:
    prefill:
      disaggregation-transfer-backend: mooncake  # user still sets this
      disaggregation-ib-device: "mlx5_0,mlx5_1"
    decode:
      disaggregation-transfer-backend: mooncake
      disaggregation-ib-device: "mlx5_0,mlx5_1"
```

`MOONCAKE_MASTER` is always computed from the runtime infra node IP — do not set it manually in `env`.

`MOONCAKE_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` is auto-resolved per-worker to that worker's own IP (using `runtime.network_interface`), so multi-node peer transfers don't fall back to `localhost`. If you need a specific NIC IP, set `MOONCAKE_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` in `env` to override the default.

**Validation:** In disaggregated mode, srtslurm rejects configs that set `mooncake_kv_store` without `disaggregation-transfer-backend: mooncake` on `sglang_config.prefill` or `sglang_config.decode`. This catches the common misconfiguration where the master process gets launched but workers fall back to default transport.

### Shadow engine recovery (vLLM, `engine.failover`)

`VLLMProtocol.failover` (recipe key `engine.failover`, dataclass `VLLMFailoverConfig` in `backends/vllm.py`) runs Dynamo's shadow engine recovery on SLURM without DRA. It implies the `gms` service (`services/gms.py`, `placement.per: worker`): one GPU Memory Service instance per vLLM worker, in the `before_workers` phase, running one `python3 -m gpu_memory_service --device k` per GPU of the worker and gated on its `GMS ready:` log line. The worker stage then launches `1 + shadow_engines` engine steps per worker and node (`<role>_<index>_<node>` and `..._e<k>`) with `--load-format gms --gms-shadow-mode`. Each engine is its own `Process` (`Process.engine_id`, emitted by `endpoints_to_processes(engines_per_process=...)`) so ports come from the usual allocators; the gms instance and the engines of a worker get the same pinned `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (no `--device-ids`) so "device k" is the same GPU for the servers and the engines, and the sockets and `failover.lock` live under `<shared_dir>/srtctl-<job_id>/<role>_<index>` (`/dev/shm`: enroot bind-mounts the host's; `/tmp` is per container). Relaunching a dead engine is `roles.<role>.restart`'s job (the supervisor's unit is one engine, not the worker). Validation (`_validate_vllm_failover`): Dynamo frontend, no sidecar mode, no DP, `load-format` gms or unset. See `docs/shadow-engine-recovery.md`; `tests/test_failover.py` is the acceptance suite.

`placement.per: worker` is the general mechanism behind the gms kind: `ServiceStageMixin.service_instances` attaches one instance to each engine-0 `Process` on the placed nodes, `ServiceLaunchContext.process` / `.config` carry the worker and the recipe to the kind, the stage pins `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, and the step is `service_<name>_<role>_<index>_<node>`. `tests/test_service_per_worker.py` covers it for a generic service.

### Services

The top-level `services:` list declares long-running processes launched next to the job (see `docs/services.md`). Each entry has a `type` that selects a `ServiceKind` registered in `src/srtctl/services/` with `@register_service("<name>")`; the kind supplies defaults (command, start phase, criticality) and the env it injects, and `ServiceStageMixin` (`src/srtctl/cli/mixins/service_stage.py`) launches every kind the same way: resolve `placement.node` to physical nodes, optional clone/build of `source`, one `srun` per node, optional TCP `readiness` gate, `ManagedProcess` into the shared registry. `start_services("before_workers")` runs after the Mooncake master; `start_services("after_frontend")` runs after the frontend is healthy.

```yaml
services:
  - name: store
    type: mooncake-store       # generic (default) | mooncake-store
    placement:
      node: workers            # head | infra | prefill | decode | agg | workers | compute | all
                               # or pool: <owner> to ride on the nodes another service owns
    env:
      MOONCAKE_GLOBAL_SEGMENT_SIZE: 100gb
    readiness:
      port: 8800
```

Adding a kind: subclass `ServiceKind`, set `default_command` / `default_start` / `default_critical`, override `validate`, `container_fallback`, `default_environment`, `forced_environment` as needed, decorate, and import it from `src/srtctl/services/__init__.py`. `srtctl dry-run` prints every service; add a `tests/test_dry_run.py` case when a kind adds visible fields.

**Metrics.** A service that serves Prometheus metrics declares `metrics: {port, path, nodes, name}` or a list of them (the scrape annotation; `nodes: first` for a cluster head, `name` required with several endpoints); `TelemetryStageMixin._service_metrics_targets` turns every endpoint into one tachometer target per node it runs on (`ServiceMetricsTarget`, endpoint `<name>_<node>`, name defaulting to the service). Kinds that always publish return their default from `ServiceKind.metrics()` and set `metrics_filter` / `metrics_endpoint_prefix` / `metrics_gpu_metadata`; the dcgm, node and process exporters are scraped this way (`core/telemetry.py` has no exporter special case left; only workers and the frontend keep their own target logic).

### Pools and services-only jobs

A service that declares `nodes: N` owns a **pool** of N whole nodes, added to the allocation after the engine roles' nodes, in `services:` order (see `docs/pools.md`). Any number of services may own nodes, next to engine roles or without them. An owner runs one instance per node of its pool (`placement.node: workers` means its own pool); `placement.pool: <owner>` makes a **rider** that runs one instance per node of that pool. A job with only pools sets `frontend.type: none`: no frontend, no worker-count health gate, the services' readiness probes are the gate before the benchmark step.

```yaml
services:
  - name: train
    type: generic
    command: ["torchrun", "--nnodes={pool_node_count}", "--nproc-per-node={gpus_per_node}",
              "--node-rank={index}", "--master-addr={pool_ip}", "train.py"]
    nodes: 2                   # pool "train": 2 nodes; instance 0 is the rendezvous; no readiness probe
                               # (instances launch one after another, gated on readiness, and a static
                               # torchrun rendezvous only completes once every node has joined)
    terminal: true             # the job ends when every instance has exited, worst exit code; no benchmark block
  - name: watcher
    type: generic
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    placement:
      pool: train              # rides on the train pool
```

Where things live:

- Carving: `Nodes.from_slurm(engine_nodes=..., pools=[(name, count), ...])` in `src/srtctl/core/runtime.py`; `Nodes.worker` is the engine nodes, `Nodes.pools` the carve, `Nodes.compute` both. Recipes without pools carve exactly as before.
- Counts: `SrtConfig.engine_node_count`, `services_node_count`, `total_nodes`, `pool_services` in `src/srtctl/core/schema.py`; rules in `_validate_services_only` and `ServiceConfig.__post_init__` (`src/srtctl/services/config.py`).
- Placement: `ServiceStageMixin.service_nodes` resolves `effective_pool`, then `placement.node` (`compute` = engine worker nodes plus every pool; `all` adds head, infra, client). The implied dcgm/node exporters run on `compute`.
- Placeholders per instance (`ServiceLaunchContext.template_vars`): `{index}`, `{node_ip}`, `{pool_node}`, `{pool_ip}`, `{pool_nodes}`, `{pool_ips}`, `{pool_node_count}`, `{gpus_per_node}`. `{head_ip}` is the job head, an engine node when a pool sits next to roles, so a cluster rendezvous uses `{pool_ip}`. Services do not inherit the recipe's top-level `environment:` (workers and the benchmark do); fabric env such as `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` goes in the service's `env:`.
- Custom benchmark env (`BenchmarkStageMixin._get_service_env`): `SRT_SERVICE_<NAME>_NODES` / `_IPS` / `_NODE_COUNT` per launched service, `SRT_GPUS_PER_NODE`, `SRT_WORKER_NODES`. This is how a launcher script drives a pool.
- Terminal services (`services[].terminal: true`): the job's run. `ServiceStageMixin.terminal_processes` collects their `ManagedProcess`es; the manual loop in `BenchmarkStageMixin.run_benchmark` returns once every one has exited, with the worst exit code, instead of holding until Ctrl+C. Refused together with a non-`manual` benchmark type or on an `external` service. Without a terminal service, manual mode holds the allocation as before.
- Readers of "every node doing work" use `runtime.nodes.compute`, not `.worker`: host setup, resource snapshot, download node, exporters. New code that means all work nodes should do the same.
- Limits: whole nodes only, fixed sizes, refused with `resources.het_jobs`. `srtctl dry-run` prints the `Nodes:` map; `tests/test_pools.py` is the acceptance suite (toy recipe through the mock orchestrator on four nodes).

### Process cleanup and graceful shutdown

Every long-running `srun` (workers, frontends, nginx, services, tachometer) is launched with a `step_name` and tracked as a `ManagedProcess` carrying the same name. `ProcessRegistry.cleanup()` stops processes by `shutdown_tier`: tier 0 (workers, frontends, sidecars) is SIGTERMed all at once through `scancel --signal=TERM --full <job>.<step>`, waited for up to each process's `terminate_timeout`, and killed if still up; then tier 1 (Mooncake master, stores), then tier 2 (etcd, NATS). SIGTERM aimed at the `srun` client itself aborts the step and SIGKILLs the task, which is why the step name matters: it is the only way the engine, router, or scraper sees the signal and gets to deregister, drain, or flush. New launch sites must pass `step_name` to both `start_srun_process` and `ManagedProcess`.

### Host Setup

`host_setup` runs commands on each node's **bare host, outside the container**, before any
worker starts — the counterpart to `setup_script`, which runs *inside* the container. Use it
for node state a container cannot reach (GPU clocks, kernel modules).

```yaml
host_setup:
  commands: ["sudo -n nvidia-smi -lmc <min>,<max>"]
  teardown: ["sudo -n nvidia-smi -rmc"]   # runs on the cleanup path, success or failure
  nodes: all                              # all | workers
```

Implemented in `SweepOrchestrator._run_host_setup()` / `._run_host_teardown()` as one
container-less `start_srun_process(container_image=None, ...)` per node. Cluster-wide default
lives in `srtslurm.yaml` as `default_host_setup` (whole-block replace, like
`default_health_check`). Commands run as the submitting user, so privileged ones need
passwordless sudo. Always pair a `commands` entry that sets persistent state with a
`teardown` — otherwise it leaks to the next job on that node.

### ResourceConfig

Supports explicit GPUs per worker (overrides computed values):

```python
resources:
  gpu_type: "gb200"
  prefill_nodes: 2
  prefill_workers: 4
  decode_nodes: 4
  decode_workers: 8
  gpus_per_prefill: 4  # Optional: explicit override
  gpus_per_decode: 2   # Optional: explicit override
```

## Testing

Tests are located in `tests/`. Run `make check` to run lint + all tests.

### Mocking SLURM

```python
class H100Rack:
    NUM_NODES = 13
    GPUS_PER_NODE = 8

    @classmethod
    def slurm_env(cls):
        return {
            "SLURM_JOB_ID": "12345",
            "SLURM_NODELIST": "h100-[01-13]",
            ...
        }

with patch.dict(os.environ, H100Rack.slurm_env()):
    with patch("subprocess.run", H100Rack.mock_scontrol()):
        # Test code here
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Backend

1. Create `backends/mybackend.py` with a dataclass implementing `BackendProtocol`
2. Implement every member of `BackendProtocol` (`backends/base.py`), including the ones your engine answers with a neutral default:
   - `get_srun_config()` - MPI settings and launch strategy (`launch_per_endpoint`, `sequential_node_start`)
   - `get_config_for_mode(mode)` - Mode-specific configuration
   - `get_environment_for_mode(mode)` - Environment variables
   - `allocate_endpoints()` - Logical worker allocation
   - `endpoints_to_processes()` - Physical process mapping; every port through `NodePortAllocator`
   - `build_worker_command(process, runtime)` - Command construction
   - `get_process_environment(process)` - Per-process env derived from `Process` ports (side channels, scan bases)
   - `mooncake_kv_store` / `get_mooncake_worker_env(...)` - the Mooncake block and its worker env; `None` / `{}` without one
   - `failover` / `get_failover_environment(...)` - shadow engine recovery; `None` / `{}` without it
   - `should_set_visible_devices()` - `True` unless the engine takes its devices on the command line; the variable is the cluster's `visible_devices_env`
   - `get_served_model_name(default)`
3. Export from `backends/__init__.py`
4. Add polymorphic deserialization in `BackendConfigField` in `schema.py`

**Current backends:**
- **SGLang**: Per-process srun launching, supports prefill/decode/aggregated modes
- **TRTLLM**: MPI-style launching (one srun per endpoint with all nodes), prefill/decode only
- **vLLM**: Per-process srun launching, prefill/decode/aggregated, `per_node` DP; `frontend_type` selects Dynamo registration or a direct `vllm serve` server, and `_CONNECTOR_MAP` owns the KV connector table

### Adding a Router Mode or a New Frontend Type

Decide first whether it is a mode or a type (see Design Rules). A mode of an existing router (a discovery flag, another connector, a transport) is an override in the existing frontend class, keyed on a backend method that resolves the effective per-role setting, with `StaticRouterFrontend` left unchanged. A new type is a different process: one module under `frontends/` decorated with `@register_frontend("<type>")`, imported from `frontends/__init__.py`, subclassing `StaticRouterFrontend` when the router takes worker URLs or `DynamicFrontend` when workers register themselves, carrying `required_backend` and its recipe rules in `validate(config)` (no schema edits), its readiness in `probe_ready` and `health_expectations`, and its port answers; then a `tests/test_<type>_frontend.py` using `start_process` as the seam, a `docs/<type>.md` page, and an `examples/` recipe.

### Adding a New Benchmark

1. Create `benchmarks/mybench.py` inheriting from `BenchmarkRunner`
2. Implement `run(config, log_dir)` method
3. Add bash script to `benchmarks/scripts/mybench/bench.sh`
4. Register in benchmark type mapping

### Adding or Changing Any Config Field

`docs/schema-reference.md` is generated from the dataclasses in `core/schema.py` and `backends/`. After adding, renaming, or re-typing a field, run `uv run srtctl schema-docs` and commit the result; CI and `tests/test_schema_docs.py` fail when the file is stale. Put the field's description in the class docstring `Attributes:` block or in a `#` comment directly above the field so it lands in the generated table.

### Adding Config That Affects srun (Mounts, Env Vars, Options)

When adding new config fields that affect what gets passed to srun (environment variables, container mounts, srun options), you must also update:

1. `show_config_details()` in `src/srtctl/cli/submit.py` -- this renders all mounts/env/options in `srtctl dry-run` output so users can verify config before submitting
2. `tests/test_dry_run.py` -- add test cases verifying the new config appears in dry-run output

Config sources that feed into dry-run display:
- **Mounts**: `config.extra_mount`, `config.container_mounts`, `default_mounts` from srtslurm.yaml
- **Env vars**: `config.environment` (global), `backend.prefill_environment`, `backend.decode_environment`, `backend.aggregated_environment`
- **srun options**: `config.srun_options`
- **Host setup**: `config.host_setup`, `default_host_setup` from srtslurm.yaml

## Debugging

### Check Generated Commands

`srtctl dry-run` shows the sbatch script, all container mounts (with source labels), environment variables (global and per-mode), and srun options:

```bash
srtctl dry-run -f config.yaml
```

### Find Full srun Commands at Runtime

The full srun command (with all mounts, env vars, and flags) is logged at INFO level in the sweep log:

```bash
tail -f outputs/<job_id>/logs/sweep_<job_id>.log | grep "srun command"
```

Per-worker env vars and commands are also logged individually (search for `Env:` and `Command:` lines).
