# Recipe Guide

How to write a job recipe in the 2.0 (`schema: 2`) layout: what each block means, how the blocks interact, and worked examples.

Field-level facts (every key, type, default, and allowed value) are generated from the code into [schema-reference.md](schema-reference.md) and checked in CI; if a prose page and the generated one disagree, the generated one is right. Agents and editors can read the same data as JSON Schema (`srtctl schema`, published at [schema/recipe.schema.json](schema/recipe.schema.json)) or per field from the MCP `explain_field` tool. The pre-2.0 layout (`backend:`, `resources.prefill_nodes`, `infra:`, ...) is in [legacy-v1.md](legacy-v1.md); `srtctl migrate -f recipe.yaml --in-place` rewrites it.

## schema

`schema: 2` is the layout this document describes and the only one that loads. A recipe without the key is the pre-2.0 layout in [legacy-v1.md](legacy-v1.md) and is rejected.

Put the key first in the file, beside `base:` in an override file. Upgrade a recipe with `srtctl migrate -f recipe.yaml --in-place`, which preserves comments and key order and folds the legacy layout into `engine:`, `roles:`, `placement:`, `services:`, and `dynamo.source` (a directory is walked recursively). A `schema: 2` recipe that still carries a pre-2.0 key (`backend:`, `infra:`, `resources.prefill_nodes`, `dynamo.hash`, ...) is rejected too; the error names the keys and `srtctl migrate` rewrites them.

```yaml
schema: 2
name: "deepseek-r1-benchmark"
```

Two rules worth knowing: a `benchmark:` field the selected type does not read is a load error (see [benchmark](benchmarks.md#benchmark)), and `roles.<role>.nodes: 0` is rejected in favor of the explicit `colocate` (see [roles](topology.md#roles)).

## name

Job name: the Slurm `--job-name` (unless `RUNNER_NAME` is set) and the run's label in results.

```yaml
name: "deepseek-r1-benchmark"
```

## model

Model and container configuration.

```yaml
model:
  path: "deepseek-r1"       # Alias from srtslurm.yaml or full path
  container: "sglang"       # Container alias from srtslurm.yaml
  precision: "fp8"          # fp8, fp4, bf16, etc.
```

Fields: [ModelConfig](schema-reference.md#modelconfig).

## output

Output configuration with formattable paths.

```yaml
output:
  log_dir: "./outputs/{job_id}/logs"
```

The `log_dir` supports FormattablePath templating. See [FormattablePath Template System](runtime-env.md#formattablepath-template-system).

## health_check

Health check configuration for worker readiness, and the worker log watch that fails a run early.

```yaml
health_check:
  max_attempts: 180
  interval_seconds: 10
  fatal_log_markers: true
  extra_fatal_log_patterns: []
```

Fields: [HealthCheckConfig](schema-reference.md#healthcheckconfig).

**Notes**:

- Default of 180 attempts at 10 second intervals = 30 minutes total wait time.
- Large models (e.g., 70B+ parameters) may require the full 30 minutes to load.
- Reduce `max_attempts` for smaller models or faster testing.

**Worker log watch** (`fatal_log_markers`): the process monitor normally learns that a worker died
from its srun step exiting. A TRT-LLM worker step is one `trtllm-llmapi-launch` task per GPU and the
engine is a child of the rank-0 task only; when that child dies the launcher prints
`Rank0 Task exit code: <n>` and the other ranks stay blocked, so the step never exits and the run
would otherwise wait out the whole health window. With the watch on, the monitor scans each critical
worker's log for the lines its engine declares fatal (TRT-LLM: `Rank<N> Task exit code: <non-zero>`
and `Failed to initialize executor`; other engines declare none) and fails the run within one monitor
poll, printing the process name and the matching line. Bare words such as `Traceback` or `MPI_Abort`
are deliberately not markers: Dynamo logs a traceback for every request cancelled at EOS, and MPI
abort lines appear on normal teardown. Use `extra_fatal_log_patterns` to add a marker for one recipe
(for example `"CUDA error: out of memory"`), and `fatal_log_markers: false` to switch the watch off,
for probes that kill workers on purpose. TRT-LLM endpoint steps are also launched with
`srun --kill-on-bad-exit=1`, so a launcher task that does exit non-zero ends the whole step.

## enable_config_dump

Accepted for compatibility; srtctl does not read it.

```yaml
enable_config_dump: true
```

SGLang (except under the `sglang` direct frontend) and vLLM workers always get `--dump-config-to`, which writes the resolved engine configuration to a JSON file in the log directory.

## Complete Examples

Every example below loads with `srtctl dry-run`. Model and container names are `srtslurm.yaml` aliases.
