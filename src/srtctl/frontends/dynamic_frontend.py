"""Shared implementation for frontends whose workers register themselves.

The counterpart of :class:`~srtctl.frontends.static_router.StaticRouterFrontend`.
A static router is launched with its worker URLs on the command line; a
dynamic frontend is launched with no worker list, workers announce
themselves over a discovery plane (Dynamo: etcd and NATS), and readiness is
the frontend's own registration count checked against the allocated
topology. Consequences shared by every such frontend live here: it fronts
any engine, it needs no per-worker URL gate before traffic, and no worker is
itself the public endpoint.

A router binary that can also take static URLs (vLLM Router's ZMQ discovery
mode) is a mode of a static router, not a dynamic frontend.

Dynamo is the only implementation today. A subclass sets ``type`` and
``worker_launch``, registers with ``@register_frontend``, parses its own
registration count in ``parse_health``, decides which rank serves which port,
and launches the process in ``start_frontends``.
