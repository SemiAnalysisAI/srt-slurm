"""The 2.0 ``placement:`` authoring surface for where the frontend and the benchmark client run.

One vocabulary replaces the per-block placement knobs::

    frontend:
      placement:
        node: head          # head | first_decode | dedicated
    benchmark:
      placement:
        node: last_decode   # head | last_decode | dedicated

``node: dedicated`` reserves a node for that component (and implies the head
location, which the legacy validation already required). Any other value is a
location string passed through. :func:`expand_placement` normalizes these blocks
into the existing internal fields before schema load, so no consumer changes and
the legacy fields still load.

| Block       | node: dedicated sets                          | node: <other> sets                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| frontend    | dedicated_node=True, orchestrator_placement=head | orchestrator_placement=<other>     |
| benchmark   | client_dedicated_node=True, client_placement=head | client_placement=<other>          |

The discovery plane (etcd, NATS) is placed through its services: an ``etcd`` or
``nats`` entry under ``services:`` with ``placement.node: dedicated``
(``srtctl.services.normalize.expand_services``). The v1 ``infra`` block still loads.
