# MLPerf benchmarking via the MLPerf team's `inference-endpoint` client.
#
# Run as a `custom` benchmark, so srt-slurm carries no MLPerf schema:
#
#   benchmark:
#     type: custom
#     command: bash /srtctl-benchmarks/mlperf/bench.sh
#     env:
#       MLPERF_CLIENT_CONFIG: /configs/dsr1-interactive-submission.yaml
#
# The client's config is passed through untouched apart from the few values
# that cannot be known until the cluster is up. That is deliberate: the config
# has ~60 nested settings (model params, two datasets with accuracy scoring,
# load pattern, a ZeroMQ transport block, drain/warmup/early-stopping), its
# shape moves with the client version, and re-expressing any of it here would
# be both a losing race and lossy - anything not modelled becomes unsettable.
# The MLPerf team's own launcher takes the same approach in
# endpoints-launch: NVIDIA/src/sflow/tools/generate_endpoint_yaml.py rewrites
# exactly one key and leaves the rest, including unresolved ${VAR} placeholders
# that the client itself expands at load time.
#
# Start from a template in the client repo
# (src/inference_endpoint/config/templates/submission_template.yaml) or one of
# the ~45 point configs in endpoints-launch under
# NVIDIA/src/configs/<system>/<model>/point_*/client.yaml.
