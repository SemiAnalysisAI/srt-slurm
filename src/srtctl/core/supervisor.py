"""Worker supervisor: relaunch a worker endpoint that exits mid-run.

The process monitor (:func:`srtctl.core.processes.start_process_monitor`) is a
circuit breaker: the first critical exit tears the job down. ``roles.<role>.critical:
false`` makes it ignore the exit instead. This module is the third option, a
reconcile loop in the Kubernetes sense: the desired state is the worker topology
the orchestrator computed at start (``backend_processes``), the observed state is
the process registry, and every monitor tick the supervisor relaunches whatever
has gone missing, subject to the role's :class:`~srtctl.core.schema.RestartPolicy`.

The unit of restart is the endpoint, not the process. A multi-node worker whose
ranks run as separate steps (SGLang TP across nodes) cannot survive losing one
rank, so the surviving siblings are stopped and the whole endpoint comes back
together. Relaunch is in place: same nodes, same GPUs, same ports, so a Dynamo
frontend sees the replacement register under a fresh instance id once the old
lease expires, and a static router sees the same URL come back.

Bookkeeping: every restart is appended to ``worker_restarts.json`` in the log
directory (picked up by the lockfile), the previous life's log is rotated to
``<log>.out.<n>`` so the crash log survives, and the relaunched step carries an
``_r<n>`` suffix so a lingering Slurm step of the same name is never signalled by
mistake.

What the supervisor does not do: reschedule onto another node (the allocation
has no spare, and only a discovery-based frontend could follow the new address),
or detect a worker that is alive but not serving. Both build on this loop.
