"""Summarise an inference-endpoint run into srt-slurm's benchmark-rollup.json.

This client does not use LoadGen; it writes its own report, specified in the
client repo at docs/metrics/report_design.md (github.com/mlcommons/endpoints).
The field list below follows that spec and was cross-checked against the output
of real MLPerf runs:

  performance/result_summary.json   qps, tps, sample counts, and ttft/tpot/latency
                                    /output_sequence_lengths blocks
  accuracy/accuracy_results.json    average_accuracy plus a per-dataset breakdown

Accuracy genuinely lives in a separate file: ``to_json`` does ``payload.pop("accuracy")``
because "result_summary.json is the performance report - accuracy lives only in
the dedicated accuracy report". So both files are read; neither is a fallback
for the other.

Two things only the real runs showed:

* The location moved. An earlier run wrote ``result_summary.json`` at the top
  level; later runs write ``performance/result_summary.json``. Both are searched,
  newest layout first.
* Every duration is in **nanoseconds**, including the ``percentiles`` maps. The
  report.txt renders them as milliseconds, so a value copied from the text
  report would be off by 1e6. Token-length series are counts and must not scale.

And two the spec showed that the runs could not: ``input_sequence_lengths`` is
absent from every fixture here (it is empty "when no ISL values were recorded,
for example no tokenizer available for text-only inputs") but is a documented
field, and ``legacy_loadgen_window_duration_ns`` records *which window* produced
qps/tps -- left ``None`` when the native window was used. Two runs' QPS are not
comparable across different windows, so the rollup carries the discriminator.

Because the layout has already moved once, a missing or restructured report is
treated as a rollup without metrics rather than as an error: the run itself
succeeded, and losing the whole record because a key moved would be worse than
recording less than we hoped for. The client takes the same line internally --
"honest incompleteness over crashes".
